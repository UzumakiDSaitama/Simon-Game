    <p>Object of the Game
    The object of Simon is to correctly repeat a sequence of flashing lights and sounds. The sequence starts short and
    simple, but gets longer and faster as the game progresses.<br><br></p>

    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    <p>Start the game: Press the start button or begin the game according to the game's instructions.<br>
    Watch the sequence: Simon will light up one or more colored buttons in a specific order. Pay close attention to the
    sequence of lights and sounds.<br>
    Repeat the sequence: Press the buttons in the same order as Simon displayed them.<br>
    Continue playing: If you repeat the sequence correctly, Simon will add another color to the sequence.<br>
    Game over: The game ends when you make a mistake by pressing the wrong button or failing to repeat the sequence
    correctly.

    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>
    You must repeat the entire sequence correctly to advance to the next level.<br>
    The sequence of lights and sounds will become longer and faster as you progress.<br>
    The game ends when you make a mistake.<br>
    Some versions of Simon may include additional features like speed settings or scoring.<br><br>

    <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
    <p>Focus on the sequence and try to memorize the pattern.<br>
